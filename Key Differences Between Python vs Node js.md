# Differences Between Python vs Node.js
Python is Object-oriented high-level language. It is invented by Guido van Rossum. It can be used for general purpose programming language. It is interpreted language.

Node.js is server-side scripting language which runs at server side, inventor of Node.js is Ryan Dahl. It is open source, cross-platform, Javascript runtime environment which is capable to Execute javascript code at server side earlier javascript was used at client side validation only With node.js it is playing its role from both side front end and backed.

Python has a library of open source data analysis tools, web frameworks, and testing instruments. Therefore, it is ecosystem one of the largest out of any programming community. It is also featuring consistency, stability, and easiness of use. It is highly preferred for developing scientific applications, big data solutions, and government projects.

As Node.js is a platform built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime it helps to develop building scalable network applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model which makes it an ideal option for developing for data-intensive real-time applications. Node.js offers greater performance and speed. It is an ideal solution for developing messaging or chatting applications. It is also useful for developing heavy-load applications and e-commerce sites that depend on the speed of processing.

It allows low-level modules inclusion to the Python interpreter. These modules allow programmers to add or customize their tools. It provides interfaces to all major commercial databases. It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP. It offers high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking. It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.

Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. This type of event mechanism benefits the server to respond in a non-blocking way. Is built on V8 JavaScript Engine makes it fastest code execution library. There is no buffering in Node.js as applications output the data in pieces.

##  Key Differences Between Python vs Node js
Below are the lists of points, describe the key Differences Between Python vs Node.js

- Python does not support Asynchronous programming by default, it supports Co routines control structure by which asynchronous processing can be achieved. Which is helpful in scaling the Small application to larger application. While in case of Node.js a single-thread asynchronous architecture with I/O operations completed outside the thread. This features of Node.js makes smooth scalability of simple web applications.
- The biggest advantage of using Python is that developers need to write fewer lines of code. While Node.js is pure JavaScript, so its basics remain simple for the developers to learn.
- It is ideal for a large project as it can do anything that can be done using PHP code. Node.js lacks the clean coding standards. That’s why it cannot be recommended for larger projects.
- Python is an ideal platform to do multiple things – web applications, integration with back-end applications, numerical computations, machine learning, and network programming. Node.js is a better choice if your focus is on web applications and website development.
- Python is suited for developing larger projects. Node.js best suited for small projects to enable functionality which needs less amount of scripting.
- Not advisable for memory intensive activities. Node.js best for memory intensive activities.
- It supports generators which makes it much simpler. Node.js supports callback. Its programming is based on event/callback that makes it process faster.
- Not an ideal platform to deal with real-time web applications Node.js is an ideal platform available right now to deal with real-time web applications.
- In case if speed Node is significantly faster. This great performance is largely due to Node.js being based on Chrome’s V8 which is a very fast and powerful engine. For this reason, Node.js speed vs that of Python is far greater which makes it a much better choice for real-time applications.
- Error handling in Python takes very less time and debugging in python is also very easy compared to Node.js So in case of error handling and debugging Python dominates over Node.js.

## Python vs Node.js Comparison Table
Following is the set of points shows the comparison between Python vs Node.js

| Basis For Comparison	| Python	| Node js |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Definition	|Python is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose, interpreted, high-level programming language.|Node.js is an open-source, cross platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code server-side.|
|Usage	| Python can be used in web programming, desktop application, gaming	 | Server side scripting language |
|Benefits	| Python enables developers to get the job done with fewer lines of code than similar object-oriented languages. Further, most developers are also comfortable with switching between Java and Python. |	Node.js is a server-side JavaScript environment. It uses an asynchronous event-driven model and is designed for writing scalable Internet applications, notably web servers. Thus, Node.js gets excellent performance based on the architectures of many Internet applications |

## Conclusion Python vs Node.js
Node.js, has superb performance and speed, is a perfect solution for applications featuring real-time messaging or chatting, as well as for heavy-load applications, content management solutions, multi-vendor marketplaces, e-commerce and other applications largely depending on the speed of processing.

Python, featuring consistency, stability, and easiness of use, is often the language of choice for scientific applications, big data solutions, government projects and machine learning.

After analysis Python and Node.js features advantages and disadvantages. We are not going to prove that Node.js is better than Python or vice versa. Indeed, both Python and Node.js have their advantages which determine their areas of application. Both Python and Node.js have rightfully earned their place in the software development world. The choice of the main technology for a project depends on multiple factors – application type, industry sector, performance requirements, developers experience, and so on. Both Python and Node.js will ensure reliable, consistent and effective solutions with the right approach. Make a smart choice, and your back will always be a solid foundation for your web application.
