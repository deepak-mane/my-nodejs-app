# Key Differences Between Angular JS vs Node JS

Some of the points are explained below that shows the Differences Between Angular JS vs Node JS
- Angular JS is a great option for building long size projects where Node JS is ideal for developing small size projects.
- Angular JS donâ€™t have to be added installed separately, one must add it like any other JavaScript file so that it be used in applications whereas Node JS must be installed on the machine.
- Angular JS is a front-end framework and can be used with any backend programming language like PHP, Java etc. whereas Node JS is simply a server-side language, in a web application like context it acts as a Java on the server side.
- Angular JS is created entirely using JavaScript whereas Node JS is written in JavaScript, C++ and C languages.
- Angular JS support real-time applications like instant messaging or chat apps whereas Node JS is best suited for real-time collaborative drawing or editing applications like Google Docs.
- Angular JS is an open source framework for the client side of the application whereas Node JS is a cross-platform runtime system and environment for applications written in JavaScript.
- Angular JS runs on the client browser whereas Node JS runs on the server side.
- Angular JS is compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera and mobile-based browsers such as an Android browser, Chrome for Mobile and so on whereas Node JS is available for Windows, Linux, Sun OS, and Mac OS.
- Angular JS is a web application framework whereas a number of frameworks are based on Node JS like Express JS, Sails JS etc.
- Angular JS is best suited for interactive single page web applications whereas Node JS is used to build fast and server-based web applications.

## Comparison Table Angular JS vs Node JS
Following is the comparison table Difference Between Angular JS and Node JS

|BASIS FOR COMPARISON | Angular JS	| Node JS
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creation	| Written entirely in JavaScript	| Written in C, C++, JavaScript |
| Application	| Single-page client-side web application	| Fast and scalable server-side application |
| Project	| Suited for highly interactive and active web projects	| Best suited for small size projects |
| Usage	| Useful for real-time applications like instant messaging	| Highly useful when scalable and faster application is required |
| Installation	| Require Angular JS file like any JavaScript file	| Need to install Node.js on system |
| Scope	| Dominate client-side interaction	| Developers can utilize it on client and server side |
| Frameworks	| It is a web application framework in itself	| Has many different frameworks like Express.js, Sails.js, and Partial.js |
| Application	| Simplify application development with a declarative approach	| More suited for an application like real-time collaborative drawing/edit like Google Docs |
